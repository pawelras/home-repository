# Home Repository
Home Repository is an e-commerce full-stack PERN app for a household items online shop and is my most complex project so far. It includes front-end React App and Express JS Server with Postgres Database and user login. State in the app is managed by Redux store with asynchoronous actions dispatched to API endpoints using Async Thunks. Server routes manage queries to SQL databade creating, returning, updating and deleting entries. User authentication is done with the use of Express Sessions and Passport JS. I have added interactivity using various react packages to provide pop up success and error messages as well as zoom in feature for images. It was challenging at times but really helped me grasp and solidify my skills especially regarding the concepts of user authentication and deploying full-stack app and how the front-end and the back-end tie together. As the registration does not require email verification please feel free create an account to see the full functionality of the app.
